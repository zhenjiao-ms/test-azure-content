# Azure AD B2C preview: Call a web API from a .NET web app


<!-- TODO [AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-web-switcher](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-web-switcher.md)]-->

By using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C, you can add powerful self-service identity management features to your web apps and web APIs in a few short steps. This article will discuss how to create a .NET Model-View-Controller (MVC) "to-do list" web app that calls a 	.NET web API by using OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens. Both the web app and web API use Azure AD B2C to manage user identities and authenticate users.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-preview-note](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-preview-note.md)]

This article does not cover how to implement sign-in, sign-up and profile management with Azure AD B2C. It focuses on calling web APIs after the user is already authenticated. If you haven't already, you should start with the [.NET web app getting started tutorial](active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-web-dotnet.md) to learn about the basics of Azure AD B2C.

## Get an Azure AD B2C directory

Before you can use Azure AD B2C, you must create a directory, or tenant.  A directory is a container for all your users, apps, groups, and more.  If you don't have one already, [create a B2C directory](active-directory-b2c-get-started.md) before you continue in this guide.

## Create an application

Next, you need to create an app in your B2C directory. This gives Azure AD information that it needs to securely communicate with your app. In this case, both the web app and web API will be represented by a single **Application ID**, because they comprise one logical app. To create an app, follow [these instructions](active-directory-b2c-app-registration.md). Be sure to:

- Include a **web app/web API** in the application.
- Enter `https://localhost:44316/` as a **Reply URL**. It is the default URL for this code sample.
- Create an **Application secret** for your application and copy it. You will need it later. Note that this value needs to be [XML escaped](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml11-20060816/#dt-escape) before you use it.
- Copy the **Application ID** that is assigned to your app. You will also need this later.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-v2-apps](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-v2-apps.md)]

## Create your policies

In Azure AD B2C, every user experience is defined by a [policy](active-directory-b2c-reference-policies.md). This web app contains three identity experiences: sign up, sign in, and edit profile. You need to create one policy of each type, as described in the [policy reference article](active-directory-b2c-reference-policies.md#how-to-create-a-sign-up-policy). When you create the three policies, be sure to:

- Choose the **Display name** and other sign-up attributes in your sign-up policy.
- Choose the **Display name** and **Object ID** application claims in every policy. You can choose other claims as well.
- Copy the **Name** of each policy after you create it. It should have the prefix `b2c_1_`. You'll need those policy names later.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-policy](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-policy.md)]

After you have created your three policies, you're ready to build your app.

Note that this article does not cover how to use the policies that you just created. To learn about how policies work in Azure AD B2C,
start with the [.NET web app getting started tutorial](active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-web-dotnet.md).

## Download the code

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-preview-note](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-bug-fix.md)]

The code for this tutorial [is maintained on GitHub](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIDConnect-DotNet). To build the sample as you go, you can [download the skeleton project as a .zip file](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIDConnect-DotNet/archive/skeleton.zip). You can also clone the skeleton:

```
git clone --branch skeleton https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIDConnect-DotNet.git
```

The completed app is also [available as a .zip file](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIDConnect-DotNet/archive/complete.zip) or on the `complete` branch of the same repository.

After you download the sample code, open the Visual Studio .sln file to get started. Notice that there are two projects in the solution: a `TaskWebApp` project and a `TaskService` project.  The `TaskWebApp` is the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) web app front end that the user interacts with. `TaskService` is the app's back-end web API that stores each user's to-do list.

## Configure the task service

When `TaskService` receives a request from `TaskWebApp`, it checks for a valid access token to authenticate the request. To validate the access token, you need to provide `TaskService` with information about your app. In the `TaskService` project, open the `web.config` file in the root of the project and replace the values in the `<appSettings>` section:

```
<appSettings>
    <add key="webpages:Version" value="3.0.0.0" />
    <add key="webpages:Enabled" value="false" />
    <add key="ClientValidationEnabled" value="true" />
    <add key="UnobtrusiveJavaScriptEnabled" value="true" />
    <add key="ida:AadInstance" value="https://login.microsoftonline.com/{0}/{1}/{2}?p={3}" />
    <add key="ida:Tenant" value="{Enter the name of your B2C tenant - it usually looks like constoso.onmicrosoft.com}" />
    <add key="ida:ClientId" value="{Enter the Application ID assigned to your app by the Azure Portal}" />
    <add key="ida:PolicyId" value="{Enter the name of one of the policies you created, like `b2c_1_my_sign_in_policy`}" />
</appSettings>
```

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-tenant-name](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-tenant-name.md)]


This article does not cover the details of how to secure `TaskService`. To learn how a web API securely authenticates requests by using Azure AD B2C, check out the [web API getting started article](active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-api-dotnet.md).

## Configure the task web app

To get `TaskWebApp` to communicate with Azure AD B2C, you need to provide a few common parameters. In the `TaskWebApp` project, open the `web.config` file in the root of the project and replace the values in the `<appSettings>` section. These values will be used throughout the web app.

```
<appSettings>
    <add key="webpages:Version" value="3.0.0.0" />
    <add key="webpages:Enabled" value="false" />
    <add key="ClientValidationEnabled" value="true" />
    <add key="UnobtrusiveJavaScriptEnabled" value="true" />
    <add key="ida:Tenant" value="{Enter the name of your B2C directory, e.g. contoso.onmicrosoft.com}" />
    <add key="ida:ClientId" value="{Enter the Application Id assigned to your app by the Azure portal, e.g.580e250c-8f26-49d0-bee8-1c078add1609}" />
    <add key="ida:ClientSecret" value="{Enter the Application Secret you created in the Azure portal, e.g. yGNYWwypRS4Sj1oYXd0443n}" />
    <add key="ida:AadInstance" value="https://login.microsoftonline.com/{0}{1}{2}" />
    <add key="ida:RedirectUri" value="https://localhost:44316/" />
    <add key="ida:SignUpPolicyId" value="[Enter your sign up policy name, e.g.g b2c_1_sign_up" />
    <add key="ida:SignInPolicyId" value="[Enter your sign in policy name, e.g. b2c_1_sign_in]" />
    <add key="ida:UserProfilePolicyId" value="[Enter your edit profile policy name, e.g. b2c_1_profile_edit" />
    <add key="api:TaskServiceUrl" value="https://localhost:44332/" />
</appSettings>
```

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-tenant-name](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-tenant-name.md)]

There are also two `[PolicyAuthorize]` decorators that require you to provide your sign-in policy name. The `[PolicyAuthorize]` attribute is used to invoke a particular policy when a user attempts to access a page in the app that requires authentication.

```C#
// Controllers\HomeController.cs

[PolicyAuthorize(Policy = "{Enter the name of your sign in policy, e.g. b2c_1_my_sign_in}")]
public ActionResult Claims()
{
```

```C#
// Controllers\TasksController.cs

[PolicyAuthorize(Policy = "{Enter the name of your sign in policy, e.g. b2c_1_my_sign_in}")]
public class TasksController : Controller
{
```

## Get access tokens and call the task API

This section will discuss how to complete an OAuth 2.0 token exchange in a web app by using Microsoft libraries and frameworks.  If you are unfamiliar with authorization codes and access tokens, you can learn more in the [OpenID Connect protocol reference](active-directory-b2c-reference-protocols.md).

### Get an authorization code

The first step in a `TaskService` web API call is to authenticate the user and receive an authorization code from Azure AD. You can receive an authorization code from Azure AD after any policy is executed successfully. These include sign-in, sign-up, and edit-profile policies.

To start, install the OWIN OpenID Connect middleware by using the Visual Studio Package Manager Console. Use OWIN to send authentication requests to Azure AD and handle their responses:

```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect -ProjectName TaskWebApp
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies -ProjectName TaskWebApp
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb -ProjectName TaskWebApp
```

Open the file `App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs`. This is where you configure the OWIN authentication pipeline by providing the details of your B2C directory and the application you created:

```C#
// App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs

public partial class Startup
{
	public const string AcrClaimType = "http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/authnclassreference";
	public const string PolicyKey = "b2cpolicy";
	public const string OIDCMetadataSuffix = "/.well-known/openid-configuration";

	// App config settings
	public static string clientId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:ClientId"];
	public static string clientSecret = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:ClientSecret"];
	public static string aadInstance = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:AadInstance"];
	public static string tenant = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:Tenant"];
	public static string redirectUri = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:RedirectUri"];

	// B2C policy identifiers
	public static string SignUpPolicyId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:SignUpPolicyId"];
	public static string SignInPolicyId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:SignInPolicyId"];
	public static string ProfilePolicyId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:UserProfilePolicyId"];

	public void ConfigureAuth(IAppBuilder app)
	{
		app.SetDefaultSignInAsAuthenticationType(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);

		app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions());

		OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions options = new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions
		{
			// These are standard OpenID Connect parameters, with values pulled from web.config
			ClientId = clientId,
			RedirectUri = redirectUri,
			PostLogoutRedirectUri = redirectUri,
			Notifications = new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationNotifications
			{
				AuthenticationFailed = OnAuthenticationFailed,
				RedirectToIdentityProvider = OnRedirectToIdentityProvider,
				AuthorizationCodeReceived = OnAuthorizationCodeReceived,
			},
			Scope = "openid offline_access",

			// The PolicyConfigurationManager takes care of getting the correct Azure AD authentication
			// endpoints from the OpenID Connect metadata endpoint. It is included in the PolicyAuthHelpers folder.
			ConfigurationManager = new PolicyConfigurationManager(
				String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, aadInstance, tenant, "/v2.0", OIDCMetadataSuffix),
				new string[] { SignUpPolicyId, SignInPolicyId, ProfilePolicyId }),

			// This piece is optional - it is used for displaying the user's name in the navigation bar.
			TokenValidationParameters = new System.IdentityModel.Tokens.TokenValidationParameters
			{
				NameClaimType = "name",
			},
		};

		app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(options);
	}
	...
}
```

### Get an access token by using the authorization code

Your web app is now configured to authenticate users by using your B2C directory, and to receive back authorization codes from Azure AD. The next step is to exchange authorization codes for access tokens from Azure AD.

When your .NET web apps need to get access tokens from Azure AD, you can use the Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL).
You don't have to use ADAL for this process, but ADAL makes it easier for you by taking care of many details. These include sending OAuth
2.0 authentication messages, caching, and refreshing tokens.

First, install ADAL in the `TaskWebApp` project by using the Package Manager Console:

```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Experimental.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory -ProjectName TaskWebApp -IncludePrerelease
```

Next, you need to pass the authorization code to ADAL so that it can get tokens for you. The OWIN OpenID Connect middleware provides a notification for you to use this authorization code. The notification will be sent each time your app receives an authorization code from Azure AD. In `App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs`, implement the `OnAuthorizationCodeReceived` notification handler by using ADAL:

```C#
// App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs

private async Task OnAuthorizationCodeReceived(AuthorizationCodeReceivedNotification notification)
{
	// The user's objectId is extracted from the claims provided in the id_token, and used to cache tokens in ADAL
	// The authority is constructed by appending your B2C directory's name to "https://login.microsoftonline.com/"
	// The client credential is where you provide your application secret, and it is used to authenticate the application to Azure AD
	string userObjectID = notification.AuthenticationTicket.Identity.FindFirst("http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/objectidentifier").Value;
	string authority = String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, aadInstance, tenant, string.Empty, string.Empty);
	ClientCredential credential = new ClientCredential(clientId, clientSecret);

	// We don't care which policy is used to access the TaskService, so let's use the most recent policy as indicated in the sign-in token
	string mostRecentPolicy = notification.AuthenticationTicket.Identity.FindFirst(Startup.AcrClaimType).Value;

	// The Authentication Context is ADAL's primary class, which represents your connection to your B2C directory
	// ADAL uses an in-memory token cache by default. In this case, we've extended the default cache to use a simple per-user session cache
	AuthenticationContext authContext = new AuthenticationContext(authority, new NaiveSessionCache(userObjectID));

	// Here you ask for a token by using the web app's clientId as the scope, because the web app and service share the same clientId.
	// The token will be stored in the ADAL token cache for use in our controllers
	AuthenticationResult result = await authContext.AcquireTokenByAuthorizationCodeAsync(notification.Code, new Uri(redirectUri), credential, new string[] { clientId }, mostRecentPolicy);
}
```

### Get an access token in the controllers

After you acquire an access token for the `TaskService` back-end and store it in ADAL's token cache, you need to use it. `TasksController` is responsible for communicating with the `TaskService` API, and it sends HTTP requests to the API to read, create,
and delete tasks. Before the HTTP request is sent, get an access token from ADAL:

```C#
// Controllers\TasksController.cs

public async Task<ActionResult> Index()
{
	AuthenticationResult result = null;
	try
	{
		string userObjectID = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst("http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/objectidentifier").Value;
		string authority = String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, Startup.aadInstance, Startup.tenant, string.Empty, string.Empty);
		ClientCredential credential = new ClientCredential(Startup.clientId, Startup.clientSecret);

		// We don't care which policy is used to access the TaskService, so let's use the most recent policy
		string mostRecentPolicy = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst(Startup.AcrClaimType).Value;

		// Here you ask for a token by using the web app's clientId as the scope, because the web app and service share the same clientId.
		// AcquireTokenSilentAsync will return a token from the token cache and throw an exception if it cannot do so.
		AuthenticationContext authContext = new AuthenticationContext(authority, new NaiveSessionCache(userObjectID));
		result = await authContext.AcquireTokenSilentAsync(new string[] { Startup.clientId }, credential, UserIdentifier.AnyUser, mostRecentPolicy);

		...
	}
	catch (AdalException ee)
	{
		// If ADAL could not get a token silently, show the user an error indicating they might need to sign in again.
		return new RedirectResult("/Error?message=An Error Occurred Reading To Do List: " + ee.Message + " You might need to log out and log back in.");
	}
	...
}
```

ADAL caches the tokens, refreshes them when they expire, and tells you when the user must sign in again by throwing exceptions. All
you do is to call `AuthenticationContext.AcquireTokenSilentAsync(...)` whenever you need a token in your app.

### Read tasks from the web API

When you have a token, you can attach it to the HTTP `GET` request in the `Authorization` header to securely call `TaskService`:

```C#
// Controllers\TasksController.cs

public async Task<ActionResult> Index()
{
	...

	try
	{
		HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
		HttpRequestMessage request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, serviceUrl + "/api/tasks");

		// Add the token acquired from ADAL to the request headers
		request.Headers.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", result.Token);
		HttpResponseMessage response = await client.SendAsync(request);

		if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
		{
			String responseString = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
			JArray tasks = JArray.Parse(responseString);
			ViewBag.Tasks = tasks;
			return View();
		}
		else
		{
			// If the call failed with access denied, then drop the current access token from the cache,
			// and show the user an error that indicates that they might need to sign in again.
			if (response.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized)
			{
				var todoTokens = authContext.TokenCache.ReadItems().Where(a => a.Scope.Contains(Startup.clientId));
				foreach (TokenCacheItem tci in todoTokens)
					authContext.TokenCache.DeleteItem(tci);

				return new RedirectResult("/Error?message=Error: " + response.ReasonPhrase + " You might need to sign in again.");
			}
		}

		return new RedirectResult("/Error?message=An Error Occurred Reading To Do List: " + response.StatusCode);
	}
	catch (Exception ex)
	{
		return new RedirectResult("/Error?message=An Error Occurred Reading To Do List: " + ex.Message);
	}
}

```

### Create and delete tasks on the web API

Follow the same pattern when you send `POST` and `DELETE` requests to the `TaskService`. Call `AuthenticationContext.AcquireTokenSilentAsync(...)` and attach the resulting token to the request in the `Authorization` header. We implemented the create action for you. You can try finishing the delete action in `TasksController.cs`.

## Sign out the user

When a user signs out of the web app, you want to clear the ADAL token cache to remove any remnants of the user's authenticated session:

```C#
// Controllers/AccountController.cs

public void SignOut()
{
	if (Request.IsAuthenticated)
	{
		// When the user signs out, clear their token cache in the process
		string userObjectID = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst("http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/objectidentifier").Value;
		string authority = String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, Startup.aadInstance, Startup.tenant, string.Empty, string.Empty);
		AuthenticationContext authContext = new AuthenticationContext(authority, new NaiveSessionCache(userObjectID));
		authContext.TokenCache.Clear();

		HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.SignOut(
		new AuthenticationProperties(
			new Dictionary<string, string>
			{
				{Startup.PolicyKey, ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst(Startup.AcrClaimType).Value}
			}), OpenIdConnectAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType, CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);
	}
}
```

## Run the sample app

Finally, build and run both `TaskClient` and `TaskService`. Sign up and sign in the app. Create tasks for the signed-in user. Sign out and sign in as a different user. Create tasks for that user. Notice how the tasks are stored per-user on the API, because the API extracts the user's identity from the access token it receives.
