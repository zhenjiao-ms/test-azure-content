# Azure Active Directory B2C preview: Register your application

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-preview-note](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-preview-note.md)]

## Prerequisite

To build an application that accepts consumer sign-up and sign-in, you first need to register the application with an Azure Active Directory B2C tenant. Get your own tenant by using the steps outlined in [Create an Azure AD B2C tenant](active-directory-b2c-get-started.md). After you follow all the steps in that article, you will have the B2C features blade pinned to your Startboard.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-v2-apps](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-v2-apps.md)]

## Navigate to the B2C features blade

You can navigate to the B2C features blade from either the Azure portal or the Azure classic portal.

### 1. Access on the Azure portal

If you have the B2C features blade pinned to your Startboard, you will see the blade as soon as you sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as the Global Administrator of the B2C tenant.

You can also access the blade by clicking **Browse** and then **Azure AD B2C** in the left navigation pane on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

You can also access the blade directly by navigating to [https://portal.azure.com/{tenant}.onmicrosoft.com/?#blade/Microsoft_AAD_B2CAdmin/TenantManagementBlade/id/](https://portal.azure.com/{tenant}.onmicrosoft.com/?#blade/Microsoft_AAD_B2CAdmin/TenantManagementBlade/id/) where **{tenant}** is to be replaced by the name used at tenant creation time (for example, contosob2c). You can bookmark this link for future use.

    > [AZURE.IMPORTANT]
    You need to be a Global Administrator of the B2C tenant to be able to access the B2C features blade. A Global Administrator from any other tenant or a user from any tenant cannot access it.

### 2. Access on the Azure classic portal

Sign in to the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/) as the Subscription Administrator. (This is the same work or school account or the same Microsoft account that you used to sign up for Azure.) Navigate to the Active Directory extension on the left and click your B2C tenant. On the **Quick Start** tab (the first tab that opens), click **Manage B2C settings** under **Administer**. This will open the B2C features blade in a new browser window or tab.

You can also find the **Manage B2C settings** link in the **B2C Administration** section on the **Configure** tab.

## Register an application

1. On the B2C features blade on the Azure portal, click **Applications**.
2. Click **+Add** at the top of the blade.
3. Enter a **Name** for the application that will describe your application to consumers. For example, you could enter "Contoso B2C app".
4. If you are writing a web-based application, toggle the **Include web app / web API** switch to **Yes**. The **Reply URLs** are endpoints where Azure AD B2C will return any tokens that your application requests. For example, enter `https://localhost:44321/`. If your application includes a server-side component (API) that needs to be secured, you'll want to create (and copy) an **Application Secret** as well by clicking the **Generate Key** button.

    > [AZURE.NOTE]
    **Application Secret** is an important security credential.

5. If you are writing a mobile application, toggle the **Include native client** switch to **Yes**. Copy down the default **Redirect URI** that is automatically created for you.
6. Click **Create** to register your application.
7. Click the application that you just created and copy down the globally unique **Application Client ID** that you'll use later in your code.

## Build a Quick Start Application

Now that you have an application registered with Azure AD B2C, you can complete one of our quick-start tutorials to get up and running. Here are a few recommendations:
