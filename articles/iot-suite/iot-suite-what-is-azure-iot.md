## Azure IoT Suite

The Microsoft Azure IoT Suite is an enterprise-grade solution that enables you to get started quickly through a set of extensible preconfigured solutions that address common IoT scenarios, such as [remote monitoring][lnk-preconfigured-solutions] and [predictive maintenance][lnk-predictive-maintenance]. These solutions are implementations of the IoT solution architecture described previously.

The preconfigured solutions are complete, working, end-to-end solutions that include simulated devices to get you started, preconfigured Azure services such as [Azure IoT Hub][], [Azure Event Hubs][], [Azure Stream Analytics][], [Azure Machine Learning][], and [Azure storage][], and solution specific management consoles. The preconfigured solutions contain proven, production-ready code that you can customize and extend to implement your own specific IoT scenarios.

You may also be interested in the [Azure IoT Hub][] service that many of the preconfigured solutions use. [Azure IoT Hub][] provides the secure and reliable bi-directional communications between devices and the cloud used in the preconfigured solution architecture.
