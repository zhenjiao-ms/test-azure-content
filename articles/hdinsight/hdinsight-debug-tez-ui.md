# Use the Tez UI to debug Tez Jobs on Windows-based HDInsight

The Tez UI is a web page that can be used to understand and debug jobs that use Tez as the execution engine on Windows-based HDInsight clusters. The Tez UI allows you to visualize the job as a graph of connected items, drill into each item, and retrieve statistics and logging information.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The information in this document is specific to Windows-based HDInsight clusters. For information on viewing and debugging Tez on Linux-based HDInsight, see [Use Ambari Views to debug Tez jobs on HDInsight](hdinsight-debug-ambari-tez-view.md).

##Prerequisites

* A Windows-based HDInsight cluster. For steps on creating a new cluster, see [Get started using Windows-based HDInsight](hdinsight-hadoop-tutorial-get-started-windows.md).

    > [AZURE.IMPORTANT] The Tez UI is only available on Windows-based HDInsight clusters created after February 8th, 2016.

* A Windows-based Remote Desktop client.

##Understanding Tez

Tez is an extensible framework for data processing in Hadoop that provides greater speeds than traditional MapReduce processing. For Windows-based HDInsight clusters, it is an optional engine that you can enable for Hive by using the following command as part of your Hive query:

    set hive.execution.engine=tez;

When work is submitted to Tez, it creates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that describes the order of execution of the actions required by the job. Individual actions are called vertices, and execute a piece of the overall job. The actual execution of the work described by a vertex is called a task, and may be distributed across multiple nodes in the cluster.

###Understanding the Tez UI

The Tez UI is a web page provides information on processes that are running, or have previously ran using Tez. It allows you to view the DAG generated by Tez, how it is distributed across clusters, counters such as memory used by tasks and vertices, and error information. It may offer useful information in the following scenarios:

* Monitoring long-running processes, viewing the progress of map and reduce tasks.

* Analyzing historical data for successful or failed processes to learn how processing could be improved or why it failed.

##Generate a DAG

The Tez UI will only contain data if a job that uses the Tez engine is currently running, or has been ran in the past. Simple Hive queries can usually be resolved without using Tez, however more complex queries that do filtering, grouping, ordering, joins, etc. will usually require Tez.

Use the following steps to run a Hive query that will execute using Tez.

1. In a web browser, navigate to https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net, where __CLUSTERNAME__ is the name of your HDInsight cluster.

2. From the menu at the top of the page, select the __Hive Editor__. This will display a page with the following example query.

        Select * from hivesampletable

    Erase the example query and replace it with the following.

        set hive.execution.engine=tez;
        select market, state, country from hivesampletable where deviceplatform='Android' group by market, country, state;

3. Select the __Submit__ button. The __Job Session__ section at the bottom of the page will display the status of the query. Once the status changes to __Completed__, select the __View Details__ link to view the results. The __Job Output__ should be similar to the following:
        
        en-GB   Hessen      Germany
        en-GB   Kingston    Jamaica
        en-GB   Nairobi Area    Kenya

##Use the Tez UI

> [AZURE.NOTE] The Tez UI is only available from the desktop of the cluster head nodes, so you must use Remote Desktop to connect to the head nodes.

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select your HDInsight cluster. From the top of the HDInsight blade, select the __Remote Desktop__ icon. This will display the remote desktop blade

    ![Remote desktop icon](./media/hdinsight-debug-tez-ui/remotedesktopicon.png)

2. From the Remote Desktop blade, select __Connect__ to connect to the cluster head node. When prompted, use the cluster Remote Desktop user name and password to authenticate the connection.

    ![Remote desktop connect icon](./media/hdinsight-debug-tez-ui/remotedesktopconnect.png)

    > [AZURE.NOTE] If you have not enabled Remote Desktop connectivity, provide a user name, password, and expiration date, then select __Enable__ to enable Remote Desktop. Once it has been enabled, use the previous steps to connect.

3. Once connected, open Internet Explorer on the remote desktop, select the gear icon in the upper right of the browser, and then select __Compatibility View Settings__.

4. From the bottom of __Compatibility View Settings__, clear the check box for __Display intranet sites in Compatibility View__ and __Use Microsoft compatibility lists__, and then select __Close__.

5. In Internet Explorer, browse to http://headnodehost:8188/tezui/#/. This will display the Tez UI

    ![Tez UI](./media/hdinsight-debug-tez-ui/tezui.png)

    When the Tez UI loads, you will see a list of DAGs that are currently running, or have been ran on the cluster. The default view includes the Dag Name, Id, Submitter, Status, Start Time, End Time, Duration, Application ID, and Queue. More columns can be added using the gear icon at the right of the page.

    If you have only one entry, it will be for the query that you ran in the previous section. If you have multiple entries, you can search by entering search criteria in the fields above the DAGs, then hit __Enter__.

4. Select the __Dag Name__ for the most recent DAG entry. This will display information about the DAG, as well as the option to download a zip of JSON files that contain information about the DAG.

    ![DAG Details](./media/hdinsight-debug-tez-ui/dagdetails.png)

5. Above the __DAG Details__ are several links that can be used to display information about the DAG.

    * __DAG Counters__ displays counters information for this DAG.
    
    * __Graphical View__ displays a graphical representation of this DAG.
    
    * __All Vertices__ displays a list of the vertices in this DAG.
    
    * __All Tasks__ displays a list of the tasks for all vertices in this DAG.
    
    * __All TaskAttempts__ displays information about the attempts to run tasks for this DAG.
    
    > [AZURE.NOTE] If you scroll the column display for Vertices, Tasks and TaskAttempts, notice that there are links to view __counters__ and __view or download logs__ for each row.

    If there was a failure with the job, the DAG Details will display a status of FAILED, along with links to information about the failed task. Diagnostics information will be displayed beneath the DAG details.

7. Select __Graphical View__. This displays a graphical representation of the DAG. You can place the mouse over each vertex in the view to display information about it.

    ![Graphical view](./media/hdinsight-debug-tez-ui/dagdiagram.png)

8. Clicking on a vertex will load the __Vertex Details__ for that item. Click on the __Map 1__ vertex to display details for this item. Select __Confirm__ to confirm the navigation.

    ![Vertex details](./media/hdinsight-debug-tez-ui/vertexdetails.png)

9. Note that you now have links at the top of the page that are related to vertices and tasks.

    > [AZURE.NOTE] You can also arrive at this page by going back to __DAG Details__, selecting __Vertex Details__, and then selecting the __Map 1__ vertex.

    * __Vertex Counters__ displays counter information for this vertex.
    
    * __Tasks__ displays tasks for this vertex.
    
    * __Task Attempts__ displays information about attempts to run tasks for this vertex.
    
    * __Sources & Sinks__ displays data sources and sinks for this vertex.

    > [AZURE.NOTE] As with the previous menu, you can scroll the column display for Tasks, Task Attempts, and Sources & Sinks__ to display links to more information for each item.

10. Select __Tasks__, and then select the item named __00_000000__. This will display __Task Details__ for this task. From this screen, you can view __Task Counters__ and __Task Attempts__.
