# Get started in the Hadoop ecosystem with a Hadoop sandbox

You can set up a Hadoop sandox (from Hortonworks) on a virtual machine to learn about the Hadoop ecosystem. The sandbox provides a local development environment to understand Hadoop, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), job submission, etc. To get started with a Hortonworks Hadoop Sandbox, see [Hortonworks Sandox](http://hortonworks.com/downloads/#sandbox) and look at the section **Hortonworks Sandbox on a VM**. We recommend you run through the tutorials available with the sandbox to get an understanding of HDFS, how jobs are submitted to a cluster, how to track jobs running on a cluster, etc.

Once you are familiar with Hadoop, you can start using Hadoop on Azure by creating an HDInsight cluster. For more information on how to get started, see [Get started with Hadoop on HDInsight](hdinsight-hadoop-linux-tutorial-get-started.md).
