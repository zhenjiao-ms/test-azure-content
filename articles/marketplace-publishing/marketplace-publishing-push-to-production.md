# Deploy your offer to the Azure Marketplace
When you are satisfied with your offer (that is, you have tested customer scenarios, marketing content, etc.) and you are ready to launch, request **Push to production** on the **Publish** tab.  

1.	These four steps on the walkthrough page should be completed and green.

2. Select the **Publish** tab from the list on the left side.

3. On the page below, click the option **Request approval to push to production**. Once the request is made, the approval team executes a final review, and then your offer will be made publically available in the Azure Marketplace. The status of the offer will change to **Listed**.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] You can always delete the offer while it is in a **Draft** status (i.e., never **Push to staging** or **Push to production**). On the **History** tab, click the **Discard draft** button at the bottom of the page to delete a draft.

> For virtual machine images, the replication across the datacenters takes 24-48 hours. Once the replication is complete, your offer will be listed in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/).

## Next steps
Once the offer goes live, test the customer scenarios to validate that all the contracts and functionality work properly in the production environment as tested and validated in the staging environment.
