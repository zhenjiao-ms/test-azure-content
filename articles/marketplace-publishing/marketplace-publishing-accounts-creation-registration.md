# Create a Microsoft Developer account
This article walks you through the necessary account creation and registration process to become an approved Microsoft Developer for the Azure Marketplace.

## 1. Create a Microsoft account
> [AZURE.WARNING] To start the publishing process, you will need to create a Microsoft account. This account will be used to register for and to sign in to both the **Microsoft Developer Center** and **Azure Publishing Portal**. You should have only one Microsoft account for your Azure Marketplace offerings. It should not be specific to services or offers.

The address that forms the user name should be on your domain and controlled by your IT team (such as publishing@example.com). Payment, tax information, and reporting will be routed through this account.

  > [AZURE.WARNING] Words like "Azure" and "Microsoft" are not supported for Microsoft account registration. Avoid using these words to complete the account creation and registration process.

### Instructions

1. Create a distribution list (DL) or security group (SG) within your company's domain.
  - Add your onboarding team to the DL.
  - The DL must be live to receive a confirmation email.
  - Use marketplace@example.com as the email address for the DL.
  - This needs to be completed in your internal systems.
2. Open a new Chrome Incognito or Internet Explorer InPrivate browsing session to ensure that you’re not signed in to an existing account.
3. Register for a Microsoft account by using the DL email.
 - You can register for a Microsoft account at [https://signup.live.com/signup.aspx](https://signup.live.com/signup.aspx).
 - Use marketplace@example.com as the email address.
 - Your Microsoft account ID is now marketplace@example.com.
4. When registering, use a valid phone number. The system will send a verification code as a text message or an automated call if identity verification is required.
5. Verify the email address sent to the DL.
6. You’re now ready to use the new Microsoft account in the Microsoft Developer Center.

> [AZURE.TIP] Using the DL allows multiple people to receive email notifications that are important for reporting of payout information. It also ensures that ownership of the Microsoft account can be transferred and isn’t tied to a single individual.

## 2. Create your Microsoft Developer Center account
The Microsoft Developer Center is used to register the company information once. The registrant must be a valid representative of the company, and must provide their personal information as a way to validate their identity. The person registering must use a Microsoft account that is shared for the company, **and the same account must be used in the Azure Publishing Portal.** You should check to make sure your company does not already have a Microsoft Developer Center account before you attempt to create one. During the process, we will collect company address information, bank account information, and tax information. These are typically obtainable from finance or business contacts.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] You must complete the following Developer profile components in order to progress through the various phases of offer creation and deployment.


| Developer profile | To start draft | Staging | Publish free and solution template | Publish commercial |
|----|----|----|----|----|
|Company registration | Must have | Must have | Must have | Must have |
|Tax profile ID | Optional | Optional | Optional | Must have |
|Bank account | Optional | Optional | Optional | Must have |


> [AZURE.NOTE] Bring Your Own License (BYOL) is supported only for virtual machines and is considered a **free** offering.


### Register your company account
1. Open a new  Internet Explorer InPrivate or Chrome Incognito browsing session to ensure that you’re not signed in to a personal account.

2. Go to [http://dev.windows.com/registration?accountprogram=azure](http://dev.windows.com/registration?accountprogram=azure).

3. Sign in with your company registration Microsoft account (e.g., marketplace@example.com).

4. Complete the "Help us protect your account" wizard, which will verify your identity via phone number or email address.

    ![drawing][img-verify]

5. In the "Registration-Account Info" section, select your **Account country/region** from the dropdown menu.

    > [AZURE.WARNING] **"Sell-from" Countries:** In order to sell your services on the Azure Marketplace, your registered entity needs to be from one of the approved “sell-from” countries above. This restriction is for payout and taxation reasons. We are actively looking to expand this list of countries in the near future, so stay tuned. For more information, see the  [Marketplace participation policies](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=526833).

6. Select your "Account Type", **Individual** or **Company**.

    > [AZURE.IMPORTANT] To better understand account types and which is best for you to choose,please view page [Account types, locations, and fees](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj863494.aspx)

7. Enter the **Publisher display name**, typically the name of your company.

    > [AZURE.TIP] Currently, the Azure Publishing Portal does not use Publisher display name. But this must be filled to complete the registration process.

8. Enter the contact info for the account.

    > [AZURE.IMPORTANT] You must provide accurate contact information because it will be used in our verification process for your company to be approved in the Developer Center.

9. For a company account, you'll also need to provide contact info for the **Company Approver**, the person who can verify that you are authorized to create the account on behalf of your organization. When you are finished, click **Next** to move on to the **"Payment section"**.

10. Enter your payment info to pay for your account. If you have a promo code that covers the cost of registration, you can enter that here. Otherwise, provide your credit card info (or PayPal in supported markets). When you are finished, click **Next** to move on to the **"Review screen"**.

11. Review your account info and confirm that everything is correct. Then, read and accept the terms and conditions of the [Microsoft Azure Marketplace Publisher Agreement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=699560). Check the box to indicate you have read and accepted these terms.

12. Click **Finish** to confirm your registration. We'll send a confirmation message to your developer email address.

13. If you are planning to publish only free offers, click **Go to Azure Marketplace Publishing Portal** and you can skip to section 3 of this document, [Register your account in the publishing portal](#3-register-your-account-in-the-publishing-portal).

14. If you are planning to publish commercial offers, click **Update your account information** where you must complete tax and banking information in your Developer Center account.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] You will not be able to properly test your offers in staging and will not be able to push your offers to production without completing the tax and bank account information.

If you prefer to update your tax and bank information later, you can go to section 3, [Register your account in the publishing portal](#3-register-your-account-in-the-publishing-portal), and come back later by using links in the Azure Publishing Portal.

### Add tax and banking information
 If you want to publish commercial offers for purchase, you also need to add payout and tax information and submit it for validation in the Developer Center. If you will publish only free offers (or BYOL offers), then you do not need to add this information. You can add it later, but it takes some time to validate the tax information. If you know that you will offer commercial offers for purchase, we recommend that you add it as soon as possible.

**Bank Information**

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Developer Center](http://dev.windows.com/registration?accountprogram=azure) with your Microsoft account.

2. Click **Payout account** in the left menu, under **Choose payment method** click **Bank account** or **PayPal**.

    > [AZURE.IMPORTANT] If you have commercial offers that customers purchase in the Marketplace, this is the account where you will receive payout for those purchases.

3. Enter the payment info, and click **Save** when you are satisfied.

    > [AZURE.IMPORTANT] If you need to update or change your payout account, follow the same steps above, replacing the current info with the new info. Changing your payout account can delay your payments by up to one payment cycle. This delay occurs because we need to verify the account change, just as we did when you first set up the payout account. You'll still get paid for the full amount after your account has been verified; any payments due for the current payment cycle will be added to the next one.

4. Click **Next**.

**Tax Information**

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Developer Center](http://dev.windows.com/registration?accountprogram=azure) with your Microsoft account (if needed).

2. Click **Tax profile** in the left menu.

3. On the **Set up your tax form** page, select the country or region where you have permanent residency, and then select the country or region where you hold primary citizenship. Click **Next**.

4. Enter your tax details, and then click **Next**.

> [AZURE.WARNING] You will not be able to push to production your commercial offers without completing the tax and bank account information in your Microsoft Developer Center account.

## 3. Register your account in the publishing portal
The Azure publishing portal is used to publish and manage your offer(s). You will find some useful information in the publishing portal that will guide you through your offer creation process.

> [AZURE.WARNING] The same company Microsoft account that was used in the Microsoft Developer Center registration must be used here. Additional users can be added to assist once the master publisher account has been created.

1.	Open a new Chrome Incognito or Internet Explorer InPrivate browsing session to ensure that you’re not signed in to a personal account.

2.	Go to [http://publish.windowsazure.com](http://publish.windowsazure.com).

3.	Sign in with your company registration Microsoft account (i.e., marketplace@example.com), and you can add co-admins as necessary.

  > [AZURE.TIP] The participation policies are described on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/marketplace/participation-policies/).
