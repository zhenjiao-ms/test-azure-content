# Enterprise integration with flat files

## Overview

You will use the flat file encoding connector from within a Logic app that encodes XML content. You may want to encode XML content before you send it to a business partner in a B2B scenario. The Logic app that you create can get its XML content from a variety of sources including from an HTTP request trigger or from another application or even from one of the many [connectors](../connectors/apis-list.md). Check out the [Logic apps documentation](./app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps.md "Learn more about Logic apps") for more about the power of Logic apps.  

## How to create the flat file encoding connector

Follow these steps to create a Logic app and add a flat file encoding connector to the Logic app

1. Create a Logic app and [link it to your integration account](./app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-accounts.md "Learn to link an integration account to a Logic app") that contains the schema you will use to encode the XML data.  
2. Add a **Request - When an HTTP request is received** trigger to your Logic app  
![](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-flatfile/flatfile-1.png)    
3. Add the flat file encoding action by:  
-  Select the **plus** sign  
-  Select the **Add an action** link that is presented after you have selected the plus sign  
-  Enter *Flat* in the search box in order to filter all the actions to the one that you want to use   
-  Select the **Flat File Encoding** action from the list

6. Select the **CONTENT** text box on the Flat File Encoding control that pops up

7. Select the body tag as the content that you want to encode. The body tag will populate the content field.

8. Select the **SCHEMA NAME** list box and choose the schema you want to use to encode the input *content* above

9. Save your work

At this point, you are finished setting up your flat file encoding connector. In a real world application, you may want to store the encoded data in an LOB application such as SalesForce or send that encoded data to a trading partner. You can easily add an action to send the output of the encoding action to Salesforce or to your trading partner using any one of the other connectors provided. 

You can now test your connector by making a request to the HTTP endpoint and including the XML content in the body of the request.  

## How to create the flat file decoding connector

### Prerequisite
You need to have a schema file already uploaded into you integration account in order to complete these steps.

1. Add a **Request - When an HTTP request is received** trigger to your Logic app  
![](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-flatfile/flatfile-1.png)    
2. Add the flat file encoding action by:  
-  Select the **plus** sign  
-  Select the **Add an action** link that is presented after you have selected the plus sign  
-  Enter *Flat* in the search box in order to filter all the actions to the one that you want to use   
-  Select the **Flat File Decoding** action from the list   
![](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-flatfile/flatfile-2.png)   
- Select the **CONTENT** control. This will produce a list of the content from earlier steps that you can use as the content to decode. You will notice the *Body* from the incoming HTTP request is available to be used as the content to decode. Note that you can also enter the content to decode directly into the **CONTENT** control. In this example, I selected *Body* to use the body of the incoming HTTP request from step 1 of the decoding steps.    
- Select the *Body* tag. Notice the body tag is now in the CONTENT control.
- Select the name of the Schema that you want to use to decode the content. In this example, I select *OrderFile*. Note that OrderFile is the name of the schema that I uploaded into my integration account at some point before.

- Select the **Save** link from the menu to save your work

At this point, you are finished setting up your flat file decoding connector. In a real world application, you may want to store the decoded data in an LOB application such as SalesForce. You can easily add an action to send the output of the decoding action to Salesforce. 

You can now test your connector by making a request to the HTTP endpoint and including the XML content you want to decode in the body of the request.
