# Deploy from Visual Studio

Although the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) gives you a great way to design and manage your Logic apps, you may also want to deploy your Logic app from Visual Studio instead. There are a couple key capabilities this enables:

- Store your Logic app alongside the other assets in your Solution, so it can contain all aspects of your application
- Keep your Logic app definition checked into source control so that you can use TFS or Git to track revisions to it 

You have to have the Azure SDK 2.7 or later installed in order to follow the steps below. Find [the latest SDK for VS](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/) here.

## Create a project

1. Go to the **File** menu and select **New** >  **Project** (or, you can go to **Add** and then select **New project** to add it to an existing solution):
    ![File menu](./media/app-service-logic-deploy-from-vs/filemenu.png)

2. In the dialog, find **Cloud**, and then select **Azure Resource Group**. Type a **Name** and then click **OK**.
    ![Add new project](./media/app-service-logic-deploy-from-vs/addnewproject.png)

3. You now need to select if you want a **Logic app** or **Logic app and API app**. Selecting **Logic app** requires you to point to existing APIs. If you select **Logic app and API app**, then you can also create a new, empty, API app at the same time. In this document, I have selected Logic App.
    ![Select Azure template](./media/app-service-logic-deploy-from-vs/selectazuretemplate.png)

4. Once you have selected your **Template**, hit **OK**.

Now your Logic app project is added to your solution. You should see the deployment file in the Solution Explorer:
![Deployment](./media/app-service-logic-deploy-from-vs/deployment.png)

## Configuring your Logic app

Once you have a project you can edit the definition of your Logic app inside Visual Studio. Click on the JSON file in the Solution Explorer. You see a placeholder definition that you can fill in with your application's logic.

We recommend that you use **parameters** throughout your definition. This is useful if you want to deploy to both a development and production environment. In that case, you should put all environment-specific configuration in the `*.parameters.json` file, and use the parameters instead of the actual strings.

Today, Visual Studio does not have a built-in JSON designer, so if you'd like to use a graphical interface (as opposed to writing JSON), use the Azure Portal. 

If you previously created a Logic app inside the Azure Portal and now want to check it in to source control, there are three ways to accomplish this: 

- Go to **Code view** in the portal and copy the definition.
- Use the Logic apps [REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt643787.aspx) to get the definition.
- Use [Azure Resource manager powershell](../powershell-azure-resource-manager.md),  specifically the [`Get-AzureResource` command](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn654579.aspx) to download the definition.

## Deploying your Logic app

Finally, after you have configured your app, you can deploy directly from Visual Studio in just a couple steps. 

1. Right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer and go to **Deploy** > **New Deployment...**
    ![New deployment](./media/app-service-logic-deploy-from-vs/newdeployment.png)

2. You are prompted to sign in to your Azure subscription(s). 

3. Now you need to choose the details of the resource group that you want to deploy the Logic app to. 
    ![Deploy to resource group](./media/app-service-logic-deploy-from-vs/deploytoresourcegroup.png)

     > [AZURE.NOTE]    Be sure to select the right template and parameters files for the resource group (for example if you are deploying to a production environment you'll want to choose the production parameters file). 
4.  Select the Deploy button
5. You'll be prompted to fix any errors that we detect. For example:
     ![Deploy to resource group](./media/app-service-logic-deploy-from-vs/deploytoresourcegrouperror.png)
 
    
6. The status of the deployment appears in the **Output** window (you may need to choose **Azure Provisioning**. 
    ![Output](./media/app-service-logic-deploy-from-vs/output.png)

In the future, you can revise your Logic app in source control and use Visual Studio to deploy new versions. 

> [AZURE.NOTE] If you modify the definition in the Azure Portal directly, then the next time you deploy from Visual Studio those changes will be overwritten.

> [AZURE.TIP] If you do not want to use Visual Studio, but still want to use tooling to deploy your Logic app from source control, you can use the [API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn948510.aspx) or [Powershell](../powershell-azure-resource-manager.md) directly to automate your deployments.
