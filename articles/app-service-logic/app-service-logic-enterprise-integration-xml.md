# XML processing

The Enterprise Integration Pack makes it easy to validate and process XML documents that you exchange with business partners. Here are the ways you can process these XML messages using Logic apps:  

- [XML validation](./app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-xml-validation.md "Learn about XML message validation")  - Provides the ability to validate the message originating from the source endpoint against a standard schema
- [XML Transform](./app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-transform.md "Learn about XML message transformations and maps") - Ability to transform the message as required by destination endpoints   
- [Flat file encoding and flat file decoding](./app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-flatfile.md "Learn about flat file encoding/decoding") - Ability to encode or decode a flat file 
- XPath (coming soon) - Ability to enrich the message and extract specified properties from the message. The extracted properties can then be used to route the message to a destination or an intermediary endpoint
