When you have an automated process or application that needs to access or modify resources, you must set up an Active Directory application and assign the required permissions to it. This topic shows you how to perform those steps through the portal. Currently, you must use the classic portal to create a new Active Directory application, and then switch to the Azure portal to assign a role to the application. 

You have two authentication options for your Active Directory application:

1. Create an id and authentication key for the application, and provide those credentials when the application runs. Use this option for automated processes that run without user interaction.
2. Enable a user to log in to Azure through your application, and then use those credentials to access resources on behalf of the user. Use this option for applications that are run by a user.

For an explanation of Active Directory concepts, see [Application Objects and Service Principal Objects](./active-directory/active-directory-application-objects.md). 
For more information about Active Directory authentication, see [Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD](./active-directory/active-directory-authentication-scenarios.md).

For detailed steps on integrating an application into Azure for managing resources, see [Developer's guide to authorization with the Azure Resource Manager API](resource-manager-api-authentication.md).

## Create an Active Directory application

1. Login to your Azure Account through the [classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).

2. Select **Active Directory** from the left pane.

     ![select Active Directory](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/active-directory.png)
     
3. Select the Active Directory that you want to use for creating the new application. If you have more than one Active Directory, you usually want to create the application in the directory where your subscription resides. You can only grant access to resource in your subscription for applications in the same directory as your subscription.  

     ![choose directory](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/active-directory-details.png)
     
    If you need to find the directory for your subscription, select **Settings** and look for the directory name.
   
     ![find default directory](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/show-default-directory.png)

3. To view the applications in your directory, click on **Applications**.

     ![view applications](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/view-applications.png)

4. If you haven't created an application in that directory before you should see something similar to following image. Click on **ADD AN APPLICATION**

     ![add application](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/create-application.png)

     Or, click **Add** in the bottom pane.

     ![add](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/add-icon.png)

5. Select the type of application you would like to create. For this tutorial, select **Add an application my organization is developing**. 

     ![new application](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/what-do-you-want-to-do.png)

6. Provide a name for the application and select the type of application you want to create. For this tutorial, create a **WEB APPLICATION AND/OR WEB API** and click the next button. If you select **NATIVE CLIENT APPLICATION**, the remaining steps of this article will not match your experience.

     ![name application](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/tell-us-about-your-application.png)

7. Fill in the properties for your app. For **SIGN-ON URL**, provide the URI to a web site that describes your application. The existence of the web site is not validated. 
For **APP ID URI**, provide the URI that identifies your application.

     ![application properties](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/app-properties.png)

You have created your application.

## Get client id and authentication key

When programmatically logging in, you need the id for your application. If the application runs under its own credentials, you will also need an authentication key.

1. Click on the **Configure** tab to configure your application's password.

     ![configure application](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/application-configure.png)

2. Copy the **CLIENT ID**.
  
     ![client id](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/client-id.png)

3. If the application will run under its own credentials, scroll down to the **Keys** section and select how long you would like your password to be valid.

     ![keys](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/create-key.png)

4. Select **Save** to create your key.

     ![save](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/save-icon.png)

     The saved key is displayed and you can copy it. You will not be able to retrieve the key later so you will want to copy it now.

     ![saved key](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/save-key.png)

## Get tenant id

When programmatically logging in, you need to pass the tenant id with your authentication request. For Web Apps and Web API Apps, you can retrieve the tenant id by selecting **View endpoints** at the bottom of the screen and retrieving the id as shown below.  

   ![tenant id](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/save-tenant.png)

You can also retrieve the tenant id through PowerShell:

    Get-AzureRmSubscription

Or, Azure CLI:

    azure account show --json

## Set delegated permissions

If your application accesses resources on behalf of a signed-in user, you must grant your application the delegated permission to access other applications. You do this in the **permissions to other applications** section of the **Configure** tab. By default, a delegated permission is already enabled for the Azure Active Directory. Leave this delegated permission unchanged.

1. Select **Add application**.

2. From the list, select the **Azure Service Management API**. Then, select the complete icon.

      ![select app](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/select-app.png)

3. In the dropdown list for delegated permissions, select **Access Azure Service Management as organization**.

      ![select permission](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/select-permissions.png)

4. Save the change.

## Configure multi-tenant application

If users from other Azure Active Directories can consent to the application and sign in to it, you must enable multi-tenancy. In the **Configure** tab, set **Application is multi-tenant** to **Yes**.

![multi-tenant](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/multi-tenant.png)

## Assign application to role

If your application is running under its own credentials, you must assign the application to a role. You must decide which role represents the right permissions for the application. To learn about the available roles, see [RBAC: Built in Roles](./active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md). 

You can set the scope at the level of the subscription, resource group, or resource. The permissions are inherited to lower levels of scope (for example, adding an application to the Reader role for a resource group means it can read the resource group and any resources it contains).

1. To assign the application to a role, switch from the classic portal to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the portal, navigate to the level of scope you wish to assign the application to. For this topic, you can navigate to a resource group, and from the resource group blade, select the **Access** icon.

     ![select users](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/select-users.png)

2. Select **Add**.

     ![select add](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/select-add.png)

3. Select the **Reader** role (or whatever role you wish to assign the application to).

     ![select role](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/select-role.png)

4. When you first see the list of users you can add to the role, you will not see applications. You will only see group and users.

     ![show users](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/show-users.png)

5. To find your application, you must search for it. Start typing the name of your application, and the list of available options will change. Select your application when you see it in the list.

     ![assign to role](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/assign-to-role.png)

6. Select **Okay** to finish assigning the role. You should now see your application in the list of uses assigned to a role for the resource group.

     ![show](./media/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/show-app.png)

For more information about assigning users and applications to roles through the portal, see [Manage access using the Azure Management Portal](role-based-access-control-configure.md#manage-access-using-the-azure-management-portal).

## Get access token in code

Your Active Directory application is now configured to access resources. In your application, you provide the credentials and receive an access token. You use this access token for requests to access resources.

You are ready to programmatically log in your application.
