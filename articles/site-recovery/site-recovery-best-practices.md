# Prepare for Azure Site Recovery deployment

Read this article for a high level overview of the deployment requirements for each replication scenario supported by the Azure Site Recovery service. After you read the general requirements for each scenario link to specific deployment details in the prerequisites section of each deployment article.

After reading this article post any comments or questions at the bottom of the article, or on the [Azure Recovery Services Forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure/home?forum=hypervrecovmgr).

## Overview

Organizations need a business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy that a determines how apps, workloads, and data stay running and available during planned and unplanned downtime, and recover to normal working conditions as soon as possible. Your BCDR strategy center's around solutions that keep business data safe and recoverable, and workloads continuously available, when disaster occurs.

Site Recovery is an Azure service that contributes to your BCDR strategy by orchestrating replication of on-premises physical servers and virtual machines to the cloud (Azure) or to a secondary datacenter. When outages occur in your primary location, you fail over to the secondary site to keep apps and workloads available. You fail back to your primary location when it returns to normal operations. Site Recovery can be used in a number of scenarios and can protect a number of workloads. Learn more in [What is Azure Site Recovery?](site-recovery-overview.md)

## Requirements for replicating VMware VMs and physical servers

The table summarizes the requirements for replicating VMware VMs and Windows/Linux physical servers to Azure and to a secondary site.

>[AZURE.NOTE] You can replicate VMware VMs and physical servers to Azure using an [enhanced](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic.md) deployment model, or with a [legacy](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic-legacy.md) model that was used for older deployments. The table below includes deployment requirements for the enhanced model.

**Component** | **Replicate to Azure (enhanced)** | **Replicate to secondary site**
---|---|---
**On-premises primary site** | You install a management server that runs all of the Site Recovery components (configuration, process, master target). | You install a process server  for caching, compressing and encrypting replication data before sending it to the secondary site. You can install additional process servers for load balancing or for fault tolerance.
**On-premises secondary site** | Not applicable | You install a single configuration server that's used for configuring, managing and monitoring the deployment.<br/><br>We recommend you install a vContinuum server for easy configuration server management.<br/><br/>You'll need to set up the master target server as a VM running on the secondary vSphere server.
**VMware vCenter/ESXi** | If you're replicating VMware VMs (or want to fail back physical servers) in your primary site you'll need a vSphere ESX/ESXi in your primary site. We also recommend a vCenter server to manage your ESXi hosts. | In your primary and secondary site you'll need one or more VMware ESXi hosts (and optionally a vCenter server).
**Failback** | You need a VMware environment to fail back from Azure, even if you're replicating physical servers.<br/><br/>You'll need to set up a process server as an Azure VM <br/><br/>The configuration server acts as a master target server, but if you're failing back large traffic volumes you might want to set up an additional on-premises master target server. [Learn more](site-recovery-failback-azure-to-vmware-classic.md)| Failback from the secondary site to the primary site is to VMware only, even if you failed over a physical machine. For failback you'll need to set up a master target server as a VM on the primary vSphere server.
**Azure account** | You'll need an [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) account and subscription. | Not applicable
**Azure storage** | You'll need an [Azure storage account](../storage/storage-redundancy.md#geo-redundant-storage) to store replicated data. Replicated data is stored in Azure storage and Azure VMs are spun up when failover occurs. | Not applicable
**Azure virtual network** | You'll need an Azure virtual network that Azure VMs will connect to when failover occurs. To fail back after failover you’ll need a VPN connection (or Azure ExpressRoute) set up from the Azure network to the on-premises site. | Not applicable
**Protected machines** | At least one VMware virtual machine or physical Windows/Linux server. During deployment the Mobility service is installed on each machine you want to replicate. | At least one VMware virtual machine or physical Windows/Linux server. During deployment the Unified agent will be installed on each machine you want to replicate.
**Connectivity** | If the management server will connect to Site Recovery via a proxy you'll need to make sure the proxy server can connect to specific URLs. | The configuration server needs internet access.

## Azure virtual machine requirements

You can deploy Site Recovery to replicate virtual machines and physical servers running any operating system supported by Azure. This includes most versions of Windows and Linux. You'll need to make sure that on-premises virtual machines that you want to protect conform with Azure requirements.


**Feature** | **Requirements** | **Details**
---|---|---
Hyper-V host | Should be running Windows Server 2012 R2 | Prerequisites check will fail if operating system unsupported

## Optimizing your deployment

Use the following tips to help you optimize and scale your deployment.

- **Operating system volume size**: When you replicate a virtual machine to Azure the operating system volume must be less than 1TB. If you have more volumes than this you can manually move them to a different disk before you start deployment.
- **Data disk size**: If you're replicating to Azure you can have up to 32 data disks on a virtual machine, each with a maximum of 1 TB. You can effectively replicate and fail over a ~32 TB virtual machine.
- **Recovery plan limits**: Site Recovery can scale to thousands of virtual machines. Recovery plans are designed as a model for applications that should fail over together so we limit the number of machines in a recovery plan to 50.
- **Azure service limits**: Every Azure subscription comes with a set of default limits on cores, cloud services etc. We recommend that you run a test failover to validate the availability of resources in your subscription. You can modify these limits via Azure support.
- **Capacity planning**: Read about [capacity planning](site-recovery-capacity-planner.md) for Site Recovery.
- **Replication bandwidth**: If you're short on replication bandwidth note that:
	- **ExpressRoute**: Site Recovery works with Azure ExpressRoute and WAN optimizers such as Riverbed. [Read more](http://blogs.technet.com/b/virtualization/archive/2014/07/20/expressroute-and-azure-site-recovery.aspx) about ExpressRoute.
	- **Replication traffic**: Site Recovery uses performs a smart initial replication using only data blocks and not the entire VHD. Only changes are replicated during ongoing replication.
	- **Network traffic**: You can control network traffic used for replication by setting up [Windows QoS](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh967468.aspx) with a policy based on the destination IP address and port.  In addition if you're replicating to Azure Site Recovery using the Azure Backup agent. You can configure throttling for that agent. [Read more](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3056159).
- **RTO**: If you want to measure the recovery time objective (RTO) you can expect with Site Recovery we suggest you run a test failover and view the Site Recovery jobs to analyze how much time it takes to complete the operations. If you're failing over to Azure, for the best RTO we recommend that you automate all manual actions by integrating with Azure automation and recovery plans.
- **RPO**: Site Recovery supports a near-synchronous recovery point objective (RPO) when you replicate to Azure. This assumes sufficient bandwith between your datacenter and Azure.
