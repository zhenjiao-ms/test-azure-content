# App Service Environment Documentation

An App Service Environment is a [Premium][PremiumTier] service plan option of Azure App Service that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely running Azure App Service apps at high scale, including [Web Apps][WebApps], [Mobile Apps][MobileApps], and [API Apps][APIApps].  

App Service Environments are ideal for application workloads requiring:

- Very high scale
- Isolation and secure network access

Customers can create multiple App Service Environments within a single Azure region, as well as across multiple Azure regions.  This makes App Service Environments ideal for horizontally scaling state-less application tiers in support of high RPS workloads.

App Service Environments are isolated to running only a single customer's applications, and are always deployed into a virtual network.  Customers have fine-grained control over both inbound and outbound application network traffic using [network security groups][NetworkSecurityGroups].  Applications can also establish high-speed secure connections over virtual networks to on-premises corporate resources.

Apps frequently need to access corporate resources such as internal databases and web services.  Apps running on App Service Environments can access resources reachable via [Site-to-Site][SiteToSite] VPN and [Azure ExpressRoute][ExpressRoute] connections.
