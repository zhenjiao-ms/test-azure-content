# Tutorial: Perform sentiment analysis using Stream Analytics and Machine Learning #

This tutorial is designed to help you quickly setup a simple Stream Analytics job with Machine Learning integration. We will leverage a Sentiment Analytics Machine Learning Model from Cortana Intelligence Gallery to analyze streaming text data and get determine the sentiment score in real time. This is a good tutorial to understand scenarios such as real time sentiment analytics on streaming twitter data, customer chat record analysis with support staff, comments on forums/blogs/videos and many other real-time predictive scoring scenarios.
  
In this tutorial a sample CSV file with text (as shown in figure 1 below) is provided as input in the Azure Blob Store. The job will apply the Sentiment Analytics model as a user-defined function (UDF) on the sample text data from the blob store. The end result will place placed within the same Azure Blob Store in another CSV file. A diagram of this configuration is provided in figure 2 below). For a more realistic scenario this blob store input may be replaced with streaming twitter data from an Azure Event Hub input. Additionally a [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) real-time visualization of the aggregate sentiment could be built. Future iterations of this article will include such extensions.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites for this article are as follows:

1.	An active Azure subscription
2.	A CSV file with some data in it. The one in Figure 2 is provided [in GitHub](https://github.com/jeffstokes72/azure-stream-analytics-repository/blob/master/sampleinputs.csv) for download, or you may create your own. This tutorial is written with the assumption that the one provided for download is used.

At a high level, the following steps will be performed:

1.	Upload the CSV input file into Blob Storage
2.	Add a Sentiment Analytics model from Cortana Intelligence Gallery to your Machine Learning workspace
3.	Deploy this model as a web service within the Azure Machine Learning workspace
4.	Create a Stream Analytics job which calls this web service as a function to determine sentiment for the text input
5.	Start the Stream Analytics job and observe the output 


## Upload the CSV input file to Blob Storage

For this step you can use any CSV file including the one specified in the introduction. To upload the file, [Azure Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com/) or Visual Studio may be used as well as custom code. For this tutorial examples are provided for Visual Studio.

1.	Expand Azure and right click on the **Storage**. Choose **Attach External Storage** and provide **Account Name** and **Account Key**.  

    ![stream analytics machine learning tutorial server explorer](./media/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial-server-explorer.png)  

2.	Expand the storage you just attached and choose **Create Blob Container** and provide a logical name. Once created, double click on the container to view its contents (which will be empty at this point).  

    ![stream-analytics machine learning tutorial create blob](./media/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial-create-blob.png)  

3.	Upload the CSV file by clicking the **Upload Blob** icon and then choose **file from the local disk**.  

## Add the Sentiment Analytics Model from Cortana Intelligence Gallery

1.	Download the [predictive sentiment analytics model](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Experiment/Predictive-Mini-Twitter-sentiment-analysis-Experiment-1) in Cortana Intelligence Gallery.  
2.	Click **Open** in the Studio:  

    ![stream analytics machine learning tutorial open machine learning studio](./media/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial-open-ml-studio.png)  

3.	Sign in to be taken to the workspace. Choose the location that best suits your location.
4.	Now click on **Run** at the bottom of the Studio  
5.	Once it runs successfully, click on **Deploy Web Service**.
6.	Now the sentiment analytics model is ready for use. To validate, click the **test** button and providing text input such as “I love Microsoft” and the test should return a similar result as shown below:

`'Predictive Mini Twitter sentiment analysis Experiment' test returned ["4","0.715057671070099"]...`

Click on the **Excel 2010 or earlier** workbook link to get your API key and the URL that you’ll need later for setting up the Stream Analytics job. (This step is only required to leverage a machine learning model from another Azure account's workspace. This tutorial assumes this is the case to address this scenario)  

![stream analytics machine learning tutorial analysis experiment](./media/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial-analysis-experiement.png)  

Take note of the web service URL and access key from the downloaded excel as shown below:
