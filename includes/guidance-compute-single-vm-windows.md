This article outlines a set of proven practices for running a Windows virtual machine (VM) on Azure, paying attention to scalability, availability, manageability, and security. 

> [AZURE.NOTE] Azure has two different deployment models: [Resource Manager][resource-manager-overview] and classic. This article uses Resource Manager, which Microsoft recommends for new deployments.

We don't recommend using a single VM for production workloads, because there is no up-time SLA for single VMs on Azure. To get the SLA, you must deploy multiple VMs in an availability set. For more information, see [Running multiple Windows VMs on Azure][multi-vm]. 

## Architecture diagram

Provisioning VM in Azure involves more moving parts than just the VM itself. There are compute, networking, and storage elements.  

![IaaS: single VM](./media/guidance-blueprints/compute-single-vm.png)

- **Resource group.** A [_resource group_][resource-manager-overview] is a container that holds related resources. Create a resource group to hold the resources for this VM.

- **VM**. You can provision a VM from a list of published images or from a VHD file that you upload to Azure blob storage.

- **OS disk.** The OS disk is a VHD stored in [Azure storage][azure-storage]. That means it persists even if the host machine goes down.

- **Temporary disk.** The VM is created with a temporary disk (the `D:` drive on Windows). This disk is stored on a physical drive on the host machine. It is _not_ saved in Azure storage, and might go away during reboots and other VM lifecycle events. Use this disk only for temporary data, such as page or swap files.

- **Data disks.** A [data disk][data-disk] is a persistent VHD used for application data. Data disks are stored in Azure storage, like the OS disk.

- **Virtual network (VNet) and subnet.** Every VM in Azure is deployed into a virtual network (VNet), which is further divided into subnets.

- **Public IP address.** A public IP address is needed to communicate with the VM&mdash;for example over remote desktop (RDP).

- **Network interface (NIC)**. The NIC enables the VM to communicate with the virtual network.

- **Network security group (NSG)**. The [NSG][nsg] is used to allow/deny network traffic to the subnet. You can associate an NSG with an individual NIC or with a subnet. If you associate it with a subnet, the NSG rules apply to all VMs in that subnet.
 
- **Diagnostics.** Diagnostic logging is crucial for managing and troubleshooting the VM.

## Recommendations

### VM recommendations

- We recommend the DS- and GS-series, unless you have a specialized workload such as high-performance computing. For details, see [Virtual machine sizes][virtual-machine-sizes]. When moving an existing workload to Azure, start with the VM size that's the closest match to your on-premise servers. Then measure the performance of your actual workload with respect to CPU, memory, and disk IOPS, and adjust the size if needed. Also, if you need multiple NICs, be aware of the NIC limit for each size.  

- When you provision the VM and other resources, you must specify a location. Generally, choose a location closest to your internal users or customers. However, not all VM sizes may be available in all locations. For details, see [Services by region][services-by-region]. To list the VM sizes available in a given location, run the following Azure CLI command:

    ```
    azure vm sizes --location <location>
    ```

- For information about choosing a published VM image, see [Navigate and select Azure virtual machine images][select-vm-image].

### Disk and storage recommendations

- For best disk I/O performance, we recommend [Premium Storage][premium-storage], which stores data on solid state drives (SSDs). Cost is based on the size of the provisioned disk. IOPS and throughput (i.e., data transfer rate) also depend on disk size, so when you provision a disk, consider all three factors (capacity, IOPS, and throughput). 

- Add one or more data disks. When you create a new VHD, it is unformatted. Log into the VM to format the disk.

- If you have a large number of data disks, be aware of the total I/O limits of the storage account. For more information, see [Virtual Machine Disk Limits][vm-disk-limits].

- For best performance, create a separate storage account to hold diagnostic logs. A standard locally redundant storage (LRS) account is sufficient for diagnostic logs.

- When possible, install applications on a data disk, not the OS disk. However, some legacy applications might need to install components on the C: drive. In that case, you can [resize the OS disk][resize-os-disk] using PowerShell.

### Network recommendations

- The public IP address can be dynamic or static. The default is dynamic.

    - Reserve a [static IP address][static-ip] if you need a fixed IP address that won't change &mdash; for example, if you need to create an A record in DNS, or need the IP address to be whitelisted.

    - You can also create a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the IP address. You can then register a [CNAME record][cname-record] in DNS that points to the FQDN. For more information, see [Create a Fully Qualified Domain Name in the Azure portal][fqdn].

- All NSGs contain a set of [default rules][nsg-default-rules], including a rule that blocks all inbound Internet traffic. The default rules cannot be deleted, but other rules can override them. To enable Internet traffic, create rules that allow inbound traffic to specific ports &mdash; for example, port 80 for HTTP.  

- To enable RDP, add an NSG rule that allows inbound traffic to TCP port 3389.

## Scalability considerations

- You can scale a VM up or down by [changing the VM size][vm-resize]. 

- To scale out horizontally, put two or more VMs into an availability set behind a load balancer. For details, see [Running multiple Windows VMs on Azure][multi-vm].

## Availability considerations

- As noted above, there is no SLA for a single VM. To get the SLA, you must deploy multiple VMs into an availability set.

- Your VM may be affected by [planned maintenance][planned-maintenance] or [unplanned maintenance][manage-vm-availability]. You can use [VM reboot logs][reboot-logs] to determine whether a VM reboot was caused by planned maintenance.

- VHDs are backed by [Azure Storage][azure-storage], which is replicated for durability and availability.

- To protect against accidental data loss during normal operations (e.g., because of user error), you should also implement point-in-time backups, using [blob snapshots][blob-snapshot] or another tool.

## Manageability considerations

- **Resource groups.** Put tightly coupled resources that share the same life cycle into a same [resource group][resource-manager-overview]. Resource groups allow you to deploy and monitor resources as a group, and roll up billing costs by resource group. You can also delete resources as a set, which is very useful for test deployments. Give resources meaningful names. That makes it easier to locate a specific resource and understand its role. See [Recommended Naming Conventions for Azure Resources][naming conventions].

- **VM diagnostics.** Enable monitoring and diagnostics, including basic health metrics, diagnostics infrastructure logs, and [boot diagnostics][boot-diagnostics]. Boot diagnostics can help you diagnose boot failure if your VM gets into a non-bootable state. For more information, see [Enable monitoring and diagnostics][enable-monitoring]. Use the [Azure Log Collection][log-collector] extension to collect Azure platform logs and upload them to Azure storage.   

    The following CLI command enables diagnostics:

    ```text
    azure vm enable-diag <resource-group> <vm-name>
     ```

- **Stopping a VM.** Azure makes a distinction between "Stopped" and "De-allocated" states. You are charged when the VM status is "Stopped". You are not charged when the VM de-allocated.

    Use the following CLI command to de-allocate a VM:

    ```text
    azure vm deallocate <resource-group> <vm-name>
    ```

    The **Stop** button in the Azure portal also deallocates the VM. However, if you shut down through the OS while logged in, the VM is stopped but _not_ de-allocated, so you will still be charged.

- **Deleting a VM.** If you delete a VM, the VHDs are not deleted. That means you can safely delete the VM without losing data. However, you will still be charged for storage. To delete the VHD, delete the file from [blob storage][blob-storage].

  To prevent accidental deletion, use a [resource lock][resource-lock] to lock the entire resource group or lock individual resources, such as the VM. 



## Security considerations

- Use [Azure Security Center][security-center] to get a central view of the security state of your Azure resources. Security Center monitors potential security issues such as system updates, antimalware, and provides a comprehensive picture of the security health of your deployment. 

    - Security Center is configured per Azure subscription. Enable security data collection as described in [Use Security Center].
    - Once data collection is enabled, Security Center automatically scans any VMs created under that subscription.

- **Patch management.** If enabled, Security Center checks whether security and critical updates are missing. Use [Group Policy settings][group-policy] on the VM to enable automatic system updates.

- **Antimalware.** If enabled, Security Center checks whether antimalware software is installed. You can also use Security Center to install antimalware software from inside the Azure Portal.

- Use [role-based access control][rbac] (RBAC) to control access to the Azure resources that you deploy. RBAC lets you assign authorization roles to members of your DevOps team. For example, the Reader role can view Azure resources but not create, manage, or delete them. Some roles are specific to particular Azure resource types. For example, the Virtual Machine Contrubutor role can restart or deallocate a VM, reset the administrator password, create a new VM, and so forth. Other [built-in RBAC roles][rbac-roles] that might be useful for this reference architecture include [DevTest Lab User][rbac-devtest] and [Network Contributor][rbac-network]. A user can be assigned to multiple roles, and you can create custom roles for even more fine-grained permissions.

    > [AZURE.NOTE] RBAC does not limit the actions that a user logged into a VM can perform. Those permissions are determined by the account type on the guest OS.   

- To reset the local administrator password, run the `vm reset-access` Azure CLI command.

    ```text
    azure vm reset-access -u <user> -p <new-password> <resource-group> <vm-name>
    ```

- Use [audit logs][audit-logs] to see provisioning actions and other VM events.

- Consider [Azure Disk Encryption][disk-encryption] if you need to encrypt the OS and data disks. 

## Example deployment script

The following Windows batch script executes the [Azure CLI][azure-cli] commands to deploy a single VM instance and the related network and storage resources, as shown in the previous diagram.

The script uses the naming conventions described in [Recommended Naming Conventions for Azure Resources][naming conventions].

```bat

## Next steps

In order for the [SLA for Virtual Machines][vm-sla] to apply, you must deploy two or more instances in an Availability Set. For more information, see [Running multiple Windows VMs on Azure][multi-vm].
