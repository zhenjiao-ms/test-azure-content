You can verify a VPN connection in the Azure portal by navigating to **Virtual network gateways** **>** ***click your gateway name*** **>** **Settings** **>** **Connections**. By selecting the name of the connection, you can view more information about the connection. In the example below, the connection is not connected and there is no data flowing through.

### To verify your connection using PowerShell

It is also possible to verify that your connection succeeded by using `Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection â€“Debug`. You can use the following cmdlet example, configuring the values to match your own. When prompted, select 'A' in order to run All.

	Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name localtovon -ResourceGroupName testrg -Debug

 After the cmdlet has finished, scroll through to view the values. In the example below, the connection status shows as *Connected* and you can see ingress and egress bytes.
